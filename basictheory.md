# Intro Theory

## Lexer

Simply understand / checks whether user is following grammar / syntax od the programming language or not.
IN go: Wherever semicolon in missied, lexer will be adding it in code before compilation

## Types in go lang

If first letter of variable or function is capital letter then it is public & any other file / program can use it in mod
EG: fmt.Println // here print ln is an public / exported

### Everything is a Type

  1. String
  2. Bool
  3. Integer
  4. Floating
  5. Complex

## Appendix

1. Compiled
2. No OOPS ❌ but structs are availbale ✅
3. use var for declaring variables
4. No Overloading
5. No Overriding
6. No try catch
7. Best for concurrent jobs
8. lexer is doing lot of stuff
9. No while loops in go (while & do while ❌)
